### Making the layout of the calculator

In this calculator, a frame is used for making the screen, and two labels, one for putting digit buttons and the other for function keys are used. I used sub-labels inside these labels to put buttons on it

### Making the screen

Entry box is used for making the screen of the calculator

### Giving life to the buttons

Till this stage my claculator was completed, virtually, it was not functionable. I tried binding buttons to the functions but the results were printed on the console and not on the calculator's screen, so I tried using lambda in the buttons and it worked!

### Giving Midas touch to the calculator

I put this code in the __init__ function of the class calculator and gave it nice color combinatons to make it look more beautiful,and here it is!
